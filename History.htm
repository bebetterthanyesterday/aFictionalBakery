It was created based on one thing in mind- the customers' pleasure. After graduating college, Jenny Nacu decided to run her own business based on the thing she loved. During her visits around the world, she was inspired by the variety a bakeshop holds around the country. On her return to the United States, her decision was final. She started her own bakery in Sugar Land, Texas. </p>
          <p align="left" class="style10">At first, the bakery consisted of only 5 employees and her whole family was involved. She was surprised about how fast word travels about the new bakery. Soon, plenty of people flooded in and Jenny created a wider variety of food in her bakery. She decided to expand the bakeshop and hire more bakers to fill the demand. Her new employees were nothing but enthusiastic in the job which helped her business grow.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style10">Until now,<em> Nacu's Bakery</em> continues to grow and is willing to start new franchises. Jenny lives by the promise of helping the unfortunate by providing them with food and shelter. No food ever gets thrown away in all her bakeries, but is given to those who cannot find a source of any food for themselves and their families. As well as giving food, Jenny has developed a program of giving money to different charities. Everytime a customer pays, a portion of it goes towards the needy and various shelters. </p></td>
